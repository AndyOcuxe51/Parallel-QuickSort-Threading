The objective for this Homework was to design a client-server paradigm using the concepts from part 2 to build a program that would sort an array using of sizes and values. Implementing the use of Threading to allow a speed up in performance. The main relationship between the server and client is that the client wants to sort an array, and by connecting to the server, the server will act as a multi-threading device that can sort array with different core amounts to speed up the sorting process. I used a quick sort algorithm which is a divide and conquer algorithm. Using the Routers from the part 2 of the semester project, I am able to connect two separate devices that donâ€™t know each other to connect in a peer-to-peer connection. I then created a menu option on the client side which allows the selection of how many cores a user can use in the sorting process. The are two thread classes, SThread and Threading. Threading holds the sorting algorithm, while Sthreads helps connect the Routers and keep them opened. The result ended in a program that allows two separate devices that can find each other and connect in a peer-to-peer style, in which a client can send an unsorted array and use the multithreaded capabilities of the server to sort the array which send the sorted array back to the user.
